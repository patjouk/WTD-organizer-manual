After the Conference
====================

This section cover the last tasks you need to do after the conference is over.

Collect Attendees Notes
-----------------------

When sending a `thank you` email to the attendees (see: :ref:`conf-communications`), ask them if they want to share notes they took during the conference.

Notes are collected and archived on the `attendee-notes <https://github.com/writethedocs/attendee-notes>`_ repository on Github.
